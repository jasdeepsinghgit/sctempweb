  This page publicly discloses the method below to establish prior art and prevent others from obtaining patent protection over the subject matter described. It is intentionally high-level and non-enabling regarding proprietary implementation details.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
A method for producing verifiable proof of delivery and reading of electronic mail by sending a single, canonical message through a dedicated routing address associated with the sender’s account. The message contains structured recipient directives. A service receives the message, interprets the directives, delivers the certified message to the intended recipients, and records transmission and engagement events to generate a tamper-evident evidence record.
</p>

<h2>Background / Problem</h2>
<p>
CC-based “certified email” schemes forward a second copy of a message, causing duplicates and breaking the evidentiary chain when recipients open only the original copy. Existing approaches also mix customers through shared addresses, complicating privacy, deliverability, and auditability.
</p>

<h2>Public Disclosure of the Method (High Level)</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Per-account routing address:</strong> Each sender is assigned a unique email routing address controlled by the certification service.</li>
  <li><strong>In-message directives:</strong> The sender includes structured recipient directives (e.g., primary, cc, bcc) inside the message content.</li>
  <li><strong>Single canonical delivery:</strong> The service receives the message at the routing address, resolves the directives, and transmits exactly one certified copy to each intended recipient.</li>
  <li><strong>Event capture:</strong> The service records transmission outcomes (e.g., sent, delivered, opened, read) for the certified copy.</li>
  <li><strong>Evidence record:</strong> The service produces an evidence record binding the transmitted content to observed events and timestamps, suitable for compliance and dispute resolution.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Distinguishing Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Prevents duplicate recipient deliveries by routing through a canonical certified path.</li>
  <li>Uses per-account routing addresses for privacy isolation and consistent deliverability.</li>
  <li>Binds delivery and engagement evidence to the exact certified copy recipients actually receive.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example Use Scenario (Non-Limiting)</h2>
<p>
A business user composes an email in a standard client and sends it to their assigned routing address, including structured directives indicating the intended recipients. The service delivers the certified message to those recipients and later provides the user with an evidence record of delivery and reading.
</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>
This disclosure covers the idea of certified email delivery achieved by sending a message through a dedicated routing address with embedded recipient directives, resulting in a single canonical certified delivery and a corresponding evidence record. Variations in format, transport, metadata, authentication, or storage are contemplated as obvious modifications.
